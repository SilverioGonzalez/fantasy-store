Why an Ecommerce site?

- It will help me learn more advantage features of Sanity Studio
- It exposes me to implementing more complex information architectures
- It help me learn how to learn what's involved in implement taxonomies
- It provides an introduction to search systems
- It gives me an opportunity to advance my web development and design abilities

What will I build? 

I'm going to follow along with a tutorial on ecommerce sites, but instead of building a clothing store, I'm going to build a nich bookstore site becuase it's more interesting to me and it's different enough to force me to solve unique problems that may not appear in the same for as the tutorial.

E-commerce Store with Next.js 13, Sanity.io, Chakra, TypeScript, Swiper | Pagination | Auth - Part 1
